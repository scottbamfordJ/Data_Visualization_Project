##[Abstract for United State Terrorism for 1970 - 2018](https://scottbamfordj.github.io/Data_Visualization_Project/Project/)

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project is my focus and interest into Terrorism. As an undergraduate I majored in International Relations and took many classes on Terrorism. I find terrorism an unexplored area in which modern day Data Analytics as well as Data visualizations hasn't fully entered. I believe that we're able to develop multiple different way of expressing Terrorist Attacks as well as using the data produce predictions and a pattern for why targets are selected and how the specific terrorist attack is done. 
Terrorism in general is also very interesting to understand as well as identify the different nuances that come with this study. Terrorism in itself is considered an "evil" as a result retaliation or even response for these attacks are considered a "good". Because of this some countries utilize this notion to produce results which the prevention of terrorist attacks is a byproduct of the action not a direct result of it. This means that leading figures in government or politics will utilize the tag of "terrorist" to allow the response to be larger than they would've been without being considered a terrorist. A Major example of this is social movements that've taken an aggressive stand.

### Question
My Question for this project is where and how many terrorist attacks actually happen in the United States? How many people are affected as well as on those specific attacks who are they focusing on and how are they accomplishing these attacks?

### Users
THe intended users are statisitcs junkies who are insterested in the actual numbers behind terrorist attacks.

### Data
The Dataset is from the GTD from 1970 - 2018. The database is from the Global Terrorism Database, apart of the START project, funded by Homeland Security. They're tasked with pooling, note taking, and categorizing terrorist attacks.
