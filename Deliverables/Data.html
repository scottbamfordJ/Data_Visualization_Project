<h2>How Data was gathered?</h2>
<p>  I got the data from the GTD (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)</p>
<h2>Cleaning of the Data</h2>
<p> To clean the data, removal of rows with null values were removed as well as the data was subset based upon the United States. 
    Specific columns were dropped because of the unncesisity of them in the dataset. The columns that were chosen were  ['Month', 'Day', 'Year', 'City of Attack', 
    'Organization Name', 'Target of Attack', 'Target Category','Attack Type', 'Weapon Details', 'Weapon Type', 'Number Wounded', "Number Killed"]. These were chosen
    because they were neccesiary for the project as well as lowered ths size of the data set moving forward.
