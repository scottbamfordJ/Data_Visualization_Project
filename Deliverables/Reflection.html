    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>My final project will have an interactable map as well as four interactable bar charts which produce a table of information. 
        This was the final decision on how everything would look at the end of the project. The way that this was chosen was through a mixture of 
        ease of adaptability from the tutorials from class as well as what fit and was able to represent the data the best. 
        Bar charts were elected the best choice because it showed in a dynamic and clean way changes in values as well as differences from one bar to the other. 
    </p>
    <p>The most helpful thing that I’ve learned was the CSS as well as how to updated graphs and charts with new information. 
        Although I do not think that the CSS was deeply explained it did open a large wealth of different paths, I could take my project 
        as well as making my project look good. The updating was the most important lesson I’ve learned from the class. 
        Graphs as well as data representation need to be able to adapt to the user’s preference and without this option, you’re just reading of a fancy paper.

        The critiques helped me frame my projects specifically stylistically as well as how the transitions would fit 
        going from one visualization to the other. Although the critiques didn’t affect the general representation of my data, it 
        did help me organize and display them in a more understandable way. The critiques are the most useful when you have a working 
        demonstration to work with. I found that even though it was a lot more work, I tried to have a demo to show in order to get a better 
        understanding of how a new user would interact as well as get lost on my page. Because of this demo I was able to cut some of the un necessary 
        parts of my project and add stream lined links to specific charts. An example of this in my own project would be the Navigation menu as well as the back to top buttons. 
        I added these because during the critiques I was told that in order to make the page a lot better and to allow for larger graphs and visuals, a navigation would allow for the user to 
        jump to specific parts of the page a lot easier.

        My final project differed mainly based upon the visualizations that I wanted to do as well as how I wanted the user to interact with the page. 
        Initially I wanted a scatter plot with a constant time scale from 1970-2018. But I ran into issues of being able to insert null values into the data in order to account 
        for instances in which there were no values on a specific year. I found that the best solution to this problem would be to make the graphs robust. 
        I chose a bar chart over the scatter plot because of the issues of having no value for a year. In the project, after you’ve selected a state and an organization, 
        a barograph will appear describing the number killed and wounded. But there are instances where an attack produced no deaths and only wounded people, 
        while other times no deaths or wounded. Because of this I had to adapt and add this additional bar chart which told the number of attacks with no wounded or deaths.  
        Another addition straying from the prospectus is the addition of a table at the end. The table displays more information on the specific type of kills in that specific year. It shows 
        all the attacks. This was vital for information on understanding the type of attack chosen as well as the different targets and weapons organizations have used in the past.

        The major challenges I faced were the different way my dataset was made compared to the examples that were shown in class. The in-class Examples used a 
        simplified dataset, so adapting knowledge from the class examples proved difficult. As well as creating and writing the appropriate code in JavaScript to create the
         scales and labels for my graphs. Although this was the major issues they were easily solved and I’ve learned greatly from them as a result. A minor issue I had was to 
         get a fuller understanding of the CSS grid. I was originally going to mesh everything together and have them sit in just one page, but after the critique section I decided 
         against this because it seemed too bulky and my peers agreed with his issue. So, I had to learn CSS Grid, my initial understanding was limited but after a lot of trial and 
         error I figured it out as well as the logic that goes with it.

        With more time and resources, I would do many additional things. First, I would make the terrorist attack map World Wide instead of United States only. 
        The Dataset originally has every country terrorist attacks as well as geo locations. Second, I would make maps for every city, so that interactions with the 
        map would cause zoom ins on the country and to the city level. I would create and make more statistical analysis on the dataset itself. I find that although the graphs 
        produce a form of analytics, it doesn’t produce any real statistical correlations or anything along those lines. My thesis as well as hopefully capstone project will look at 
        the relationships between terrorist attacks, terrorist targets, and weapon types in different countries. And then integrate those relationships into the web page. 
        Making so that one person could put in a country or a state and look at the type of terrorist attacks most likely to happen within that area. My thought process was a terrorism 
        web md where individuals could go to in order to diagnose the type of potential terrorist attack they would get into, 
        similar to how individuals would go to Web MD to diagnose themselves because of a cough.
