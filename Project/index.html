    <h3>United States Terrorism from 1970 - 2018</h3>
      <p>
        United States Terrorism has become a major reason for its Involvement in International problems and activites. The rational is that in order to protect within the boarders of the
        country we must prevent terrorist organizations from developing outside of the country. With the advancement in technology as well as Globalization, just preventing terrorist groups
        from developing outside of the country has major limitations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project, is to visualize the Number of Terrorist Attacks in the United States, as well as quantify their effects in terms of Wounded and Killed. Although this isn't the
        full picture in terms of US terrorist attacks, this does present a good understanding of the how and where terrorist attacks occur. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The data that was used in order to create these visualizations is from the GTD, Global Terrorism Database (START, 2021). The GTD is funded by homeland security and has been collecting and codifying
        terrorist attacks. After removing null and missing values, as well as sorting for just United States Attacks the end result is what is being displayed in the website.
