    <h3>United States Terrorism from 1970 - 2018</h3>
      <p>
        United States Terrorism has become a major reason for its Involvement in International problems and activites. The rational is that In order to protect within the boarders within
        the country we can do this by preventing people terrorist organizations from developing outside of the country. But with the interconnectivity that countries have with one another as well
        technological advances creates another problem of Terroristr ORganizations recuriting as well as planning and exucting attacks without in person communcations.
