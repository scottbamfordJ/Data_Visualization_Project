## Terrorism 

Post 9/11 Terrorism has become a hot topic in not only evidence for defense spending increases but also for explanatory evidence for international tourism and international cooperation. Within the United States there has been numerous attacks, the GTD the global terrorism database, has attempted to track these attacks. They've tried to label as well as quantify how to code a terrorist attack as well as taking time to highlight attacks which could be considered something else but based upon their labeling, they've qualified it as such. 

The GTD is an amazing source for terrorism centered information as well as terrorism datasets. But not many will take the time to read as well as inform themselves on the actuality that is terrorism. Specifically, the different groups and the frequency and body count these organizations have. The goal of this project is to focus on the United States and allow for an explorable United States map which identifies the number of attacks from 1970 - 2018. And identify the areas in which these terrorism organizations plan and attack these areas. Another goal of the project is to see the spread of attacks within each organization.

The United States with its status as a first world country has attempted and tried to display itself as un affected or plagued by Terrorism, and instead try to describe its self as a combatant of Terrorism. Because of this when a terrorist attack happens, many are shocked and are bewildered that such a thing has happened within the warm and "safe" boundaries of the United States. This tool is seeking to help enlighten as well as answer questions regarding the regularity of United States Terrorism as well as the location and repercussions of said attacks.

## [Abstract for United State Terrorism for 1970 - 2018](https://scottbamfordj.github.io/Data_Visualization_Project/Project/)

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project is my focus and interest into Terrorism. As an undergraduate I majored in International Relations and took many classes on Terrorism. I find terrorism an unexplored area in which modern day Data Analytics as well as Data visualizations hasn't fully entered. I believe that we're able to develop multiple different way of expressing Terrorist Attacks as well as using the data produce predictions and a pattern for why targets are selected and how the specific terrorist attack is done. 
Terrorism in general is also very interesting to understand as well as identify the different nuances that come with this study. Terrorism in itself is considered an "evil" as a result retaliation or even response for these attacks are considered a "good". Because of this some countries utilize this notion to produce results which the prevention of terrorist attacks is a byproduct of the action not a direct result of it. This means that leading figures in government or politics will utilize the tag of "terrorist" to allow the response to be larger than they would've been without being considered a terrorist. A Major example of this is social movements that've taken an aggressive stand.

### Question
My Question for this project is where and how many terrorist attacks actually happen in the United States? How many people are affected as well as on those specific attacks who are they focusing on and how are they accomplishing these attacks?

### Users
THe intended users are statisitcs junkies who are insterested in the actual numbers behind terrorist attacks.

### Data
The Dataset is from the GTD from 1970 - 2018. The database is from the Global Terrorism Database, apart of the START project, funded by Homeland Security. They're tasked with pooling, note taking, and categorizing terrorist attacks.
