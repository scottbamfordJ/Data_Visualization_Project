## Terrorism 

Post 9/11 Terrorism has become a hot topic in not only evidence for defense spending increases but also for explanatory evidence for international tourism and international cooperation. Within the United States there has been numerous attacks, the GTD the global terrorism database, has attempted to track these attacks. They've tried to label as well as quantify how to code a terrorist attack as well as taking time to highlight attacks which could be considered something else but based upon their labeling, they've qualified it as such. 

The GTD is an amazing source for terrorism centered information as well as terrorism datasets. But not many will take the time to read as well as inform themselves on the actuality that is terrorism. Specifically, the different groups and the frequency and body count these organizations have. The goal of this project is to focus on the United States and allow for an explorable United States map which identifies the number of attacks from 1970 - 2018. And identify the areas in which these terrorism organizations plan and attack these areas. Another goal of the project is to see the spread of attacks within each organization.

The United States with its status as a first world country and is considered a main combatant of Terrorism. The United States has many international operations and resources used to prevent 
terrorism in the foriegn countries, as well as locally. But this doesn't mean that local terrorism is curbed and impossible to happen within the United States espeically post 9/11 US. But terrorism hasn't just come about in the 2000's. This project is used to visualize terrorism in the US from 1970 - 2018 as well as look at not only the spread of terrorist attacks but also the impact on human lives in both number of killed and wounded.
